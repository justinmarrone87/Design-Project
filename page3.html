                Watching high level, or NHL games is a really good method 
                <br>to expand your game in hockey.  It's almost like getting 
                <br>secret tips from experts. There is so much to learn from what 
                <br>every NHL player does, and how they do it.  Almost every, or at 
                <br>least a lot of moves made in every NHL game, are much more 
                <br>complex than they actually seem. There is a lot of thought into 
                <br>each play that the players are making, even if it looks like it’s 
                <br>nothing.  Now, from watching NHL games, you can easily pick up 
                <br>on a lot of the plays that they are making, which I strongly 
                <br>recommend that you do if you want to improve your game.

                Paying attention to how these NHL players pass, skate, and score 
                <br>will help you understand the game so much better.  There is 
                <br>almost no other way as good as learning from the best of the best, 
                <br>to improve your game in hockey. This is also the simplest way that 
                <br>you can become a better hockey player, because all you have to do 
                <br>is sit there and watch a hockey game, which not only can be very 
                <br>educational, but very enjoyable at the same time.  If you start 
                <br>watching and actually analyzing NHL games, and each play that they 
                <br>make, you will start to pick up on them and take them into action 
                <br>in your own games, and in no time, you will see great improvement.
