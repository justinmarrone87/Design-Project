            Off-ice training is the thing that no one really sees, but it really steps up your 
            <br>game and all the work put in pays off.  Off-ice training is just as effective as 
            <br>actual training on-ice, and doing, for example, simple at-home workouts can 
            <br>equally level up your skills as if you were training on the ice. Strengthening the 
            <br>muscles with exercises involving muscles that are used in hockey, is really 
            <br>important because they can make you very dominant on the ice. Keep in mind 
            <br>that you don't necessarily have to be training like a bodybuilder, trying to build 
            <br>muscle everywhere, whereas you are simply just trying to build more strength 
            <br>in the muscles you need for hockey, but training like a bodybuilder wouldn't 
            <br>necessarily be a bad thing.

                Strengthening your muscles with exercises like squats and lunges, will help 
                <br>build strength in your legs, which is very useful on the ice.  Also, working on agility 
                <br>drills is also extremely important. For example, a good and simple agility drill would 
                <br>be to set up cones in a straight line, and about 2 feet apart from each other.  From 
                <br>the first cone, you want to quickly move side to side while going forwards as fast as 
                <br>you can, and when you reach the end, you do the same thing while backwards, and 
                <br>you repeat. Also, another thing that is important is doing cardio, for example going 
                <br>on a run everyday, because this really helps your endurance, which is really 
                <br>important when you are playing high level hockey. Other simple exercises you can 
                <br>do are pushups, jumping jacks, burpees, planks, box jumps, etc.
