         <p>In this website, nothing here should be unexpected, and it 
            <br>should all be basic things, but when all the tips I will 
            <br>provide are put into work, then you will definitely see 
            <br>improvement. This website is based on my personal 
            <br>experience and knowledge, along with research that I've 
            <br>done. On this website, I am going to be talking about 4 
            <br>steps to actively follow, if you want to achieve more 
            <br>skill in hockey. These 4 steps consist of: on-ice training, 
            <br>off-ice training, watching high level/NHL games, and 
            <br>staying in shape.

            <p>I am a 14 year old hockey player that plays Bantam AA. I am a good 
                <br>enough hockey player and I know what I am talking about, which is why 
                <br>I am able to come up with all the information gathered on this website. 
                <br>I have played AA hockey my whole life since I was in atom, to peewee, 
                <br>now to bantam, so I have a lot of experience with different styles of 
                <br>training, and different styles all around of playing hockey. The 
                <br>position that I play is defense, but I have experience of forward from 
                <br>my early years of hockey, but primarily I am a defense, and I know more 
                <br>about that position, but I still have a lot of knowledge about forward 
                <br>as well.
