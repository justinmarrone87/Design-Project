            <p class="paragraph-11">If you want to become better at hockey, you need to play more 
                <br>often and be on the ice as much as possible. On-ice training is 
                <br>very important when it comes to becoming a better hockey player. 
                <br>Actually training on-ice is by far the most important action if 
                <br>you want to become better. You need to be on the ice multiple 
                <br>times a week to practice, and to also play games, because games 
                <br>are also very important. You can do a lot of practicing, whether 
                <br>it's on your shot, skating, etc. but games are still just as 
                <br>important because they work on your hockey IQ and your in-game 
                <br>senses, which is one of, if not the most important thing in hockey.

            <p class="paragraph-22">
                One of the easiest things you can do to get more ice time is to do training 
                <br>sessions with a few people and with a trainer. You should do these once or 
                <br>twice a week, depending on how much you’re already on the ice with your 
                <br>team. These types of training sessions are usually the most beneficial, 
                <br>because it is not like a team practice with your coach, and it is much more 
                <br>individualized, where you can improve on just yourself. To become better, 
                <br>you need to do many different drills involving your shooting abilities, 
                <br>skating, stopping, your edge work, passing, use of physical contact, timing, 
                <br>puck handling, deking, backwards skating, and more. With more private 
                <br>sessions with trainers, you can easily work on all of these things to perfect 
                <br>your game. Also, in every practice, every game, and every training session, 
                <br>you have to work as hard as you can, with every single move you do, 
                <br>everything has to be with 100% effort and max level intensity, or else if 
                <br>you only give 75% effort, you can't get better by doing so.
