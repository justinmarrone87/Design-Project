                Eating healthy and staying in shape can easily be a bonus to your hockey 
                <br>skills, and make you so much better, just by being in shape.  A good 
                <br>example of this is how every car needs gas to run, and just like those cars, 
                <br>our bodies need the best fuel to last longer on the ice, skate faster, and 
                <br>dominate.  We need a lot of nutrients in our bodies, so it is important to 
                <br>always eat our fruits, the proper foods so that we play better on the ice.  
                <br>Also, staying in shape is very important when it comes to playing hockey as 
                <br>well, because it makes it very hard to stop you, which is extremely important.

                Because our bodies need a lot of nutrients, you need to be eating healthy 
                <br>foods like fruits, vegetables, our proteins (meat) and our carbs (rice, 
                <br>potatoes, etc.), and lots of water.  Those foods and drinks will give you 
                <br>exactly the energy you need to be performing highly on the ice.  Now, 
                <br>staying in shape, I will talk about more on “page 5”, but I will still 
                <br>address some key parts. Staying in shape is really important for hockey. 
                <br>Staying in shape means you have to be working out, off ice, not 
                <br>necessarily in a gym, but you can do many exercises anywhere just with 
                <br>your body.  Being in shape and strong will benefit you a lot, meaning you 
                <br>will take hits and feel nothing, it'll be hard for people to take the puck 
                <br>off of you, and it'll make you have better endurance, and have quicker 
                <br>recoveries on the ice.  A healthy diet and good programs to stay in shape, 
                <br>is very important to improving your game in hockey.
